The first icon for *When did* was pretty awful but good enough for [the MVP](http://when-apps.com/2014/05/10/implementing-an-mvp/).

As soon as I had the MVP out the door I went back to the drawing board on the icon.

I started by just writing down words that came to mind. Time, timeless, past, present, reflect, celebrate, and mourn.

Then I started thinking of imagery that helped me feel those things and looking at earth from space immediately came to mind (I may have watched the movie [Gravity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/) a few days earlier :grin:). I tried drawing it with the pens I had.

Next I opened [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) for the first time ever and started learning how to use it. Sketch ended up being very straightforward, getting started with it was a breeze :+1: In less than an hour I had the new icon finished.

After seeing the old icon next to related apps in the Appstore I'm really glad I took the time to create a better icon.
