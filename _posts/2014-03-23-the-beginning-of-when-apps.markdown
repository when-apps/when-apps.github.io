I came up with the idea for the **When did** app while walking in San Francisco with my wife and our best friend. Our best friend asked "when did you adopt your dog Bailey?" I had to think pretty hard, then do some math to come up with an estimate. I had my phone out at the time and I wondered why I couldn't ask my phone this question.

I actually started [hacking on the app](https://github.com/when-apps/whendid-ios/commit/ff296a75b47c1f55bdf1ecc300ff262053eff474) before [I wrote up the idea](https://github.com/jonmagic/product/blob/master/when_did/README.md). Pretty quickly though I decided [having the idea written down](https://github.com/jonmagic/product/commit/049248b6ce3680dd60c952178c17e919cf5fb0f7#diff-2fe300fd311a3c028ae4d5287286a200) would be good to reference and help me stay on track.

An hour or two into implementing an [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) I decided to [create issues for all of the features and improvements](https://github.com/when-apps/whendid-ios/issues?page=1&state=closed) I wanted, to keep me on track and give me a way to look back at my thought process.

I did the bulk of the work to ship the first version to the App Store in one day, a couples hours in the morning and then a few in the afternoon and evening. It ended up taking just shy of 10 hours to implement the main features, create an icon, and figure out the App Store and iTunes Connect dance. I'll write about those experiences more in detail later.

**Coming soon** to an iTunes App Store near you!
