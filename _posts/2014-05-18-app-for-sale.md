*When did* went on [sale in the Appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/when-did/id846475828?mt=8) on April 14th and since then has sold two copies!

I actually forgot that I scheduled it to be released on the 14th and hadn't worked on it or even shipped the new icon until I got an email the other day about my "Sales in April".

That $4.27 was just enough motivation for me to ship version 1.0.1 with the updated icon.
